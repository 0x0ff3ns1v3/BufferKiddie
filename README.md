# BufferKiddie
OSCP Buffer overflow script. Still being refined as of 08OCT2020.

The goal of this script is to create a one stop shop for conducting buffer overflows on applications with no need to create and heavily edit a multiple scripts. The end state concept is to run this singular script and not require any other scripts from development to exploitation.
